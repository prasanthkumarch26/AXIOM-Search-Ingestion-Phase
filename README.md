# A.R.I.S. – Paper Intelligence System

A production-grade asynchronous full-text search and ingestion system for scientific papers (arXiv).  
Built using a **read-through cache architecture with PostgreSQL GIN-based full-text search**, enabling real-time scientific paper retrieval, indexing, and ranking.

---

## ⚡ System Performance (Load Tested)

### Peak Load: 600 users @ 25 users/sec

- **Throughput:** ~295 RPS (1M+ requests/hour equivalent)
- **Latency:** P95 ~58ms, P99 ~130ms
- **Error Rate:** ~0% (13–46 transient failures over 1M+ requests)
- **Cache Performance:**
  - `/cache/search`: P95 ~56ms
  - `/search`: P95 ~63ms

### Stability Under Load

- Sustained performance under **500–600 concurrent users**
- No cascading failures under 30-minute stress tests
- Controlled degradation under peak load via cached query reuse
- Stable throughput under sustained high-concurrency traffic

## 🧠 System Architecture

A **read-through cache + on-demand ingestion pipeline**:

1. User query hits FastAPI backend
2. System first checks **PostgreSQL GIN full-text search index**
3. On cache miss:
   - Async fetch from arXiv API
   - XML parsing and abstract chunking
   - Conversion into PostgreSQL `tsvector`
   - Indexed in real time for future queries
4. Ranked results returned using PostgreSQL `ts_rank`

This design ensures repeated queries are served directly from indexed storage, minimizing external API dependency.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Asynchronous Ingestion Pipeline
- Built with `httpx` for non-blocking HTTP requests
- Async XML parsing for arXiv Atom feeds
- Efficient chunking of scientific abstracts for indexing

### Full-Text Search Engine (PostgreSQL GIN)
- Sentence-level abstract decomposition
- PostgreSQL native `to_tsvector` indexing
- Ranked retrieval using `ts_rank`
- Deduplication using `DISTINCT ON`
- Sub-100ms query performance for cached data

### Read-Through Cache Design
- Cache layer backed by pre-indexed PostgreSQL results
- Avoids repeated ingestion for previously queried topics
- Ensures low-latency repeated query execution

### High-Concurrency Data Layer
- `asyncpg` connection pooling for high throughput
- Lock-coordinated ingestion to prevent duplicate writes
- Safe concurrent query + ingestion handling

### Frontend Optimization
- Next.js 15 App Router with React Server Components (RSC)
- Server-side data fetching eliminates CORS overhead
- Optimized UI rendering for fast search response display
